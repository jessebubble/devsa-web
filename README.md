# devSA

devSA is a community of creatives and technologists who share a common goal: leverage the power of the web to deliver exceptional user experiences.

The user doesn't care about the tools you use, and neither do we. This platform is here for you to share your work, ask for help, find inspiration, and contribute to the growth of this community.

Our goal is to provide support by connecting the worlds of design, marketing, web, mobile and cloud development.

⚠️ REMIX FUTURE CHANGE: The `@remix-run/vercel` runtime adapter has been deprecated in favor of out of the box Vercel functionality and will be removed in Remix v2. Please update your code by removing `@remix-run/vercel` & `@vercel/node` from your `package.json`, removing your `server.js`/`server.ts` file, and removing the `server` & `serverBuildPath` options from your `remix.config.js`.
